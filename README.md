# Football-Match-Analytics
The goal of this project is to develop a prediction system that can accurately predict whether a home team will win or not in a football match. We will use four different machine learning algorithms-SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost to develop our prediction system and then apply ensemble learning to further boost accuracy.
